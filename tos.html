	<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
	<br><br>
	<div class="box">
		<h5>
			Please read this carefully before using our site. This is a contract between you and Queue. We have also included several annotations that aren't a part of the contract itself, but are intended to emphasize key sections and help you follow the text. We have tried to be fair and straightforward. Please feel free to email us if you have any questions or suggestions!
			<br><br>
			1. Accepting the Terms of Service
			<br><br>
			Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using Queue (the "Site") and/or the other domains, websites, products, applications, mobile applications, services, and/or Content provided by Queue, Inc. (all of those collectively with the Site, the "Services") By using or accessing the Services, you ("Subscriber" or "you") agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you should not, and are not permitted to, use the Services.
			<br><br>
			2. Modifications to this Agreement
			<br><br>
			Queue reserves the right to modify this Agreement by (1) posting a revised Agreement on and/or through the Services and (2) providing notice to you that this Agreement has changed, generally via email where practicable, and otherwise through the Services (such as our mobile applications). Modifications will not apply retroactively. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Agreement.
			<br><br>
			We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to (or reject) a revised version of this Agreement. In such cases, modifications will be effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of this Agreement. If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use the Services.
			<br><br>
			In cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement to a modified version of this Agreement, but otherwise provide notice as set forth above, the modified version of this Agreement will become effective fourteen days after we have posted the modified Agreement and provided you notification of the modifications. Your use of the Services following that period constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified. If you do not agree to the modifications, you are not permitted to use, and should discontinue your use of, the Services.
			<br><br>
			As Queue grows and improves, we might have to make changes to these Terms of Service. When we do, we will let you know. We are also going to make it a practice to post old versions so it is easy to see changes/additions/deletions. To see old versions, scroll down to the end of this document.
			<br><br>
			3. Use of the Services
			<br><br>
			Service Changes and Limitations:
			<br><br>
			The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change without prior notice to you. Queue retains the right to create limits on and related to use of the Services in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice. Queue may also impose limits on certain Services or aspects of those Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. Queue may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Content (as defined below). Queue may also terminate or suspend Accounts (as defined below) at any time, in its sole discretion.
			<br><br>
			Queue is an evolving platform. With new products, services, and features launching all the time, we need flexibility to make changes, impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings (like features that flop). We can also terminate or suspend any account at any time. That sounds harsh, but we only use that power when we have a reason, as outlined in these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.
			<br><br>
			Limitations on Automated Use:
			<br><br>
			You may not, without express prior written permission, do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (a) tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, or the computer or delivery systems of Queue and/or its service providers; (b) probe, scan, or test any system or network (particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise attempt to breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (c) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Queue (d) scrape the Services, and particularly scrape Content (as defined below) from the Services; (e) use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information, including without limitation by forging TCP-IP packet headers or email headers; or (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any Subscriber, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a virus to, spamming, or overloading the Services, or by scripted use of the Services in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.
			<br><br>
			Do not do bad things to Queue or to other users. Some particularly egregious examples of "bad things" are listed in this section.
			<br><br>
			4. Registration, Queue URLs, and Security
			<br><br>
			As a condition to using certain of the Services, you may be required to create an account (an "Account") and select a password using your email address, which will serve as a default link to your default Queue account.
			<br><br>
			You agree to provide Queue with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, particularly your email address.
			<br><br>
			It is really important that the email address associated with your Queue account is accurate and up-to-date. If you ever forget your password - or worse, fall victim to a malicious phishing attack - a working email address is often the only way for us to recover your account.
			<br>
			You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account password and for the security of your Account, and you will notify Queue immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Account or Account password.
			<br><br>
			5. Privacy
			<br><br>
			For information about how Queue collects, uses, and shares your information, please review our <a href="http://scs.ryerson.ca/~mcuddalo/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. You agree that by using the Services you consent to the collection, use, and sharing (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of such information.
			<br><br>
			6. Termination
			<br><br>
			Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying the other party. Queue may terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. In particular, Queue may immediately terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged.
			<br><br>
			Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to use or access that Service will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability. Termination of your access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability that you otherwise may have to Queue or any third party.
			<br><br>
			7. Miscellaneous
			<br><br>
			This Agreement, as modified from time to time, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Queue with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the parties. The failure of either party to exercise, in any way, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain enforceable and in full force and effect. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with Queue's prior written consent. Queue may assign this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without your consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Queue in any respect whatsoever.
