			<b>What Queue is for:</b>
			<br><br>
			Queue celebrates curiosity and open discussions. We want you to ask questions openly on Queue and explore, share and discuss topics close to your heart.
			<br><br>
			<b>What Queue is not for:</b>
			<br><br>
			Malicious Speech. Do not encourage violence or hatred on the basis of things like race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation. We encourage you to dismantle negative speech through argument rather than censorship. We will, however, remove anything that is overtly malicious.
			<br><br>
			Harm to Minors. Be thoughtful when posting anything involving a minor. Do not post or solicit anything relating to minors that is sexually suggestive or violent. Do not bully minors, even if you are one. Being a teenager is complicated enough without the anxiety, sadness, and isolation caused by bullying.
			<br><br>
			Gore, Mutilation, Bestiality, or Necrophilia. Do not post gore just to be shocking. Do not showcase the mutilation or torture of human beings, animals, or their remains.
			<br><br>
			Uploading Sexually Explicit Video. You can embed anything in a Queue post as long as it is lawful and follows our other guidelines.
			<br><br>
			Misattribution or Non-Attribution. Make sure you always give proper attribution and include full links back to original sources. 
			<br><br>
			Spam. Do not spam people. Do not make spammy posts, do not post spammy replies, do not send people spammy messages. Be a regular human. Spam does not belong on Queue.
			<br><br>
			Mass Registration or Automation. Do not register accounts or post content automatically, systematically, or programmatically.
			<br><br>
			Copyright or Trademark Infringement. Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others.
			<br><br>
			Confusion or Impersonation. Don't do things that would cause confusion between you and a person or company. Do not impersonate anyone.
			<br><br>
			Harassment. Don't attempt to circumvent the Ignore feature or otherwise try to communicate with someone who has asked you to stop.
			<br><br>
			Privacy Violations. Don't use Queue to deceptively obtain personal information. Don't post content that violates anyone's privacy, especially personally identifying or confidential information like credit card numbers, social security numbers, or unlisted contact information.
			<br><br>
			Unlawful Uses or Content. This one's pretty obvious, but Queue is not a place for illegal behavior, including fraud, phishing, or illegally inciting violence.
			<br><br>
			If we conclude that you are violating these guidelines, you may receive a notice via email. If you do not explain or correct your behavior, we may take action against your account. 
			<br><br>
			You can report violations of these guidelines to us directly.
			<br><br>
			We also reserve the right to amend these guidelines using the procedures set forth in our <a href="http://scs.ryerson.ca/~mcuddalo/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>.
			<br><br>
			If you have questions or feedback, don't hesitate to let us know.
			<br><br>
			Thanks for reading all of this, by the way. Welcome to <a href="http://scs.ryerson.ca/~mcuddalo/queue.html">Queue</a>.
